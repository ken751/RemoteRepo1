hey guys i believe that there is a need here for 
us to re-architect our backend with new tooling 
and applications that we will use as    LMS (
learning management system ) and CMS( contend 
management system).
here the goal for us now it is having these two
new apps to allow our customers or any end-users
to be able create his own learning management
sytem so that he or they can learn more efficiently so
they would be powered to make their layout and load 
the way they like.
the CMS comes in to the picture which will 
also be a backend application that will allow
users to users to do a lot of WRITING OPERATIONS 
on the database so they would be able upload
their own videos and content on the app or website.
they will also be able to read articles written 
by saviors of the field aligned with their interests. so
this will emcompasses a lot of READ ONLY OPERATIONS 
on the READ REPLICA database so that will take off the 
overhead on the our PRIMARY DATABASE.

I am adding a second item here on this second file
